Question 5 answer:


5a) Input is an impulse function, so the output is going to be constant of 1/255.

5b) When the impulse function got spread out, it becomes a box filter, which will become a sinc function. The magnitude graph looks different than the sinc function because it starts at zero but then when it cycles back, we will have a sinc function. 

5c) When the box filter got bigger, we will have a narrower sinc function because as the input is getting bigger in space, the frequency decrease. 

5d) If the input is constant, the frequency will be the impulse. 

5f) The output looks the same as 5b, but the magnitude is 10 times bigger. 

5g) The magnitude looks the same as 5b, but the phase is now a lot faster
